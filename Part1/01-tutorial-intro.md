# SciPy 2015 Jupyter advanced tutorial

This is some of the material that cover the advance Jupyter/IPython SciPy tutorial
that is/was/will be given in July 2015.

During this tutorial we will cover a few non-usual topics for Jupyter/IPython
and in particular concerning the notebook.

The topics we will cover are the following:

How can you extend the notebook's functionality, first by installing already available extensions, then how to write your own. It will take a little knowledge of javascript, but don't worry, we have a recap for you.

We'll briefly go into the structure of the different configuration and extension folders, where you should store files and how to retrieve them.

We'll have a look at some of the Jupyter Notebook APIs to do some easy customisation, and rebind keyboard shortcut.

We will walk you on how to write an extension that provide custom keyboard shortcut, and action that the user can trigger.

Extension can also extend the notebook server, and you can add custom `handlers` to allow some processing. You will probably be happy to do a bit of Python.  

Once you are Javascript experts, we can go into writing your own widgets, with all the view on the javascript side that talk to Python object in the kernel.

We will finish with some demo on how you can install jupyterHub to get a multi-user install.

By the end of this tutorial you shoudl be able to hack the JupyterNotebook to cover your own need.
